Hi! My name is Morena Rong and I am a rising junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University.

The repositories on this account are some of the fun projects I've worked on during my time here. Some were for classes I've taken and others are from my free time. Some projects cannot be uploaded due to concerns for security and academic integrity involving the reuse of assignments.

Please also feel free to check out the final project I worked on with a team for CS3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming, in OCaml, which can be located here: https://github.com/rz96/neverwing

If you have any questions, you can contact me at mr942@cornell.edu.
