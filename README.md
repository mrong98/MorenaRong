Hi! My name is Morena Rong and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University.

This is a repository of some of the fun projects I've worked on during my time here. Some were for classes I've taken and others are from my free time.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at mr942@cornell.edu.
