Hi! My name is Morena Rong and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University.

This is a repository of some of the fun projects I've worked on during my time here. Some were for classes I've taken and others are from my free time. Some files had to be removed due to current university courses continuing to use the same assignments out of concern for academic integrity.
Please also feel free to check out the final project I worked on with a team for CS3110, which can be located here: https://github.com/rz96/neverwing

If you have any questions, you can contact me at mr942@cornell.edu.
